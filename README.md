# Analyze the ToothGrowth Data

## Description
This project analyzes the ToothGrowth dataset from the R datasets package. The objective is to investigate the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs, comparing two types of supplements (orange juice and ascorbic acid) and different dosage levels.

## Technologies Used
- R
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- R Markdown

## Steps to Run
1. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your system.
2. Install necessary R packages if not already installed:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"))
   ```
3. Download the `ToothGrowth` dataset, which is included in the R datasets package.
4. Open the `ToothGrowth_analysis.Rmd` file in RStudio.
5. Knit the R Markdown file to generate the report in HTML or PDF format:
   - Click the "Knit" button in RStudio and select the desired output format (HTML or PDF).

## Results
The analysis shows that:
- There is a statistically significant difference in tooth length between the two types of supplements (vitamin C vs. orange juice).
- Higher doses of vitamin C resulted in greater tooth growth in guinea pigs.
